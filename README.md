### Hey :wave:, I'm Maxson!

I'm always trying to learn new things,and most of the repositories on this profile have to do with some sort of exploration into a certain technology, whether that be reverse engineering, emulation, web development, etc. 

I've privated *most* of my repositories, including some with stars and forks, if you were using any of my repositories, feel free to contact me.
