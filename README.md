### Hey :wave:, I'm Maxson!

I'm a computer science student out of New Mexico. I started programming at a very young age and have always been interesting in computers and how they work. I'm always trying to learn new things, most of the repositories on this profile have to do with some sort of exploration into a certain technology, whether that be reverse engineering, emulation, web development, etc. 

I've privated *most* of my repositories, including some with stars and forks, if you were using any of my repositories, feel free to contact me.
